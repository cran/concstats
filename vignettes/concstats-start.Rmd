## <i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i> What is concstats?

concstats is a small package that helps you to **calculate the structure,
concentration or diversity measures of a given market.** You can reach that goal
in different ways:  
a) calculating an individual measure, e.g. the Herfindahl Hirschmann Index (HHI)
   or its dual.  
b) calculating a group of measures, e.g. structural measures, or  
c) a selected set of measures in a one-step procedure.


## <i class="fas fa-download"></i> How can you install it?

To install the latest development version of `concstats` directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/schneiderpy/concstats) or use: 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = "hide", eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("schneiderpy/concstats")
```

# </a><i class="fas fa-table"></i> Why did I build it?

Measures of concentration and competition are important and give a first insight
of a given market structure in a particular market. **They are important to
determine public policies and strategic corporate decisions**. However, in
research and in practice the most commonly used measure is the Herfindahl
Hirschman Index. The `concstats` package offers a set of alternative measures.

`concstats` allows you to **calculate quickly a particular measure or a group of
measures to give you a better overview of a given market situation and therefore
reducing uncertainty.** **It can be used by practitioners and academics alike.**

## <i class="fas fa-code"></i> How can it be used?

`concstats` should be used by practitioners and academics **who are concerned about
a given market situation regarding its structure, concentration, diversity or
inequality**. **A single standard measure like the Herfindahl Hirschmann Index
(HHI) may lead to erroneous conclusions.** The `concstats` package offers a
**straightforward way to calculate standard and alternative measures** given a
data set of market participants and their participation (in absolute or relative
values) in a particular market at a given point of time or over time.
concstats provides currently the following basic functions:

- **concstats** calculates eight pre-selected measures in a one-step procedure
to provide a first insight of the market.
- **mstruct** is a wrapper for the following measures: **firm**, **nrs_eq**
(Numbers equivalent), **top**, **top 3** and **top 5** market share, and **all**
calculates all measures as a group.
- **comp** is a group wrapper for the following concentration measures: **hhi**,
the **dual of the hhi**, the **min. of the hhi**, the **dominance index**, the
**stenbacka index**, and finally **all** which calculates all measures as a group.
- **inequ** is a wrapper for inequality and diversity measures and contains:
**entropy**, **gini coefficient**, **simpson index**, the **palma ratio** and the
alternative **grs** measure, **all** calculates the group measures.
