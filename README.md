Measures of concentration and competition are important and give a first
insight of a given market structure in a particular market. They are
important to determine public policies and strategic corporate
decisions. However, in research and in practice the most commonly used
measure is the Herfindahl Hirschmann Index. The goal of the `concstats`
package is to offer a set of alternative and/or additional measures to
better determine a given market structure and therefore reduce
uncertainty with respect to a given market situation. Various functions
or groups of functions are available to achieve the desired goal.

\-`concstats` calculates a set of pre-selected concentration and
diversity measures in a one-step procedure.  
-`mstruct` offers market structure measures, e.g. the sum of Top3 or
Top5 market shares.  
-`comp` is a wrapper for concentration measures, e.g. the Herfindahl
Hirschmann Index.  
-`inequ` offers diversity or inequality measures, e.g. the Entropy or
the Palma ratio.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/schneiderpy/concstats) or:

``` r
install.packages("devtools") # a package for developing R packages
devtools::install_github("schneiderpy/concstats")
```

## How to use `concstats`

### `concstats`

has one main function which calculates a set of pre-selected measures in
a one-step procedure.

### `mstruct`

is a wrapper to calculate different structural measures. Within this
group are measures like the number of firms, numbers equivalent,
cumulative Top 3 and Top 5 market share. The measures might be
calculated as a group or individually.

### `comp`

is a group wrapper to calculate different concentration measures. Within
this group are measures like the Herfindahl-Hirschmann index (HHI), the
dual of the HHI, the Dominance or the Stenbacka index.

### `inequ`

is a group of inequality and diversity measures, e.g. Entropy, Gini
coefficient, Palma ratio.

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to calculate an individual
measure or a set of market structure and concentration measures:

``` r
library(concstats)
## Create some simple data
share1 <- c(0.4, 0.2, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0, 0)
share_hhi <- hhi(share1) # the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
#> [1] 0.275

share_dom <- dom(share1) # the Dominance Index
#> [1] 0.4127273

## Create some other simple data
share2 <- c(0.35, 0.4, 0.05, 0.1, 0.06, 0.04) # market shares of each firm in
                                              # the market (should sum up to 1)

## Calculate a selected set of market structure and concentration measures
share2_con <- concstats(share2) # creates share2_con, a selected set of measures
#>         Measures Values
#> 1          Firms   6.00
#> 2 Nrs_equivalent   3.33
#> 3        Top (%)  40.00
#> 4       Top3 (%)  85.00
#> 5       Top5 (%)  96.00
#> 6            HHI   0.30
#> 7    Entropy(RE)   0.79
#> 8    Palma ratio   2.67
```

In this case, the result is a table with eight selected measures: 1)
Number of firms, 2) Numbers equivalent of firms, 3) Top firm, share in
%, 4) Top 3 firms, share in %, 5) Top 5 firms, share in %, 6) The
Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index, in decimal form, 7) Normalized Entropy
(RE), a value between 0 and 1, 8) Palma ratio, an inequality score which
measures the ratio of the top 10 percent to the bottom 40 percent.
